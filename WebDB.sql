The FAO also points to supply-side reasons such as delayed harvests and reduced sugar cane production in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, consumer prices are also pushed up by investment cash flows into the market, as investors diversify risks among the highly liquid t&agrave;ifinancial market trường.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, food producers in Asia have raised prices to offset the high cost of raw materials. Major food importing countries such as Japan,&nbsp;Korea&nbsp;and China are seeing many impacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The price is still increasing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nisshin Seifun Group (Japan) is expected to increase the price of wheat flour products by 2-4% in July, due to higher raw material prices, as well as higher logistics and packaging costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food manufacturer Ajinomoto (Japan) will also increase the price of mayonnaise by 1-10% next month due to the &nbsp;oil price&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in the past few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Korea, the largest bakery chain, Paris Baguette, increased the price of &nbsp;bread&nbsp;by 5.6% in February due to the increase in the price of ingredients. In China, the price of some soybean oil increased by as much as 20% in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economist Chua Hak Bin of Maybank Kim Eng Financial Services Company said that high food prices will be an obstacle to Asia&#39;s economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower-income households and poorer countries will be hit harder, as most of their income is spent on food, he said. In addition, these countries also have less access to vaccines and lack the resources to cushion the impact of rising food prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Farmers, exporters benefit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts say that rising food prices contribute to job creation and income growth in rural areas. Nikkei Asia, citing data from the Central Bank of Thailand, showed that the country&#39;s agricultural income increased 14% in April compared to the same period last year. The net profit of agribusiness trader Wilmar International (Singapore) reached $450 million in the first quarter of 2021, nearly doubling from the same period last year. However, a prolonged pandemic and deterioration in some Asian economies could affect food supply and demand, complicating price forecasts.</p>\r\n', 3, NULL, 1, '2021-11-12', 0, NULL);

This includes a sizable oil field in the Permian Basin in the southwest of the United States. Responding to the media, a representative of Shell declined to comment on the above information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Important turning point</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to analysts, it is quite understandable that &quot;Shell reduces its operations&quot; because last month, the group was ruled by a court in the Netherlands to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. in total sales compared to 2019. And the reduction should reach 6% in 2023. Shell responded that the ruling was unreasonable, but observers said it was difficult to change the ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the emission rate of petroleum products that Shell provides is difficult to cut. So the above ruling almost means that Shell has to cut production. For a long time, energy corporations have always shied away from responsibility for reducing emissions when arguing that customers are the users, not they use oil and gas. Therefore, the above judgment of the court in the Netherlands has a turning point, setting a precedent that other oil and gas corporations will also be subject to similar judgments. Currently, both Shell and the Exxon Mobil and Chevron corporations (both US) are investing heavily in &ldquo;technology&rdquo; to find ways to reduce emissions in the oil and gas products they supply, and at the same time &ldquo;developing renewable energy&rdquo; create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opportunities for state oil and gas giants?<br />\r\nNot only Shell, other private oil and gas groups are also tending to reduce their operations. Bloomberg reported that Exxon Mobil has decided to withdraw from a joint venture in an oil exploration project in Iraq. The Iraqi side sought out other private oil and gas groups in the world to invite Exxon Mobil&#39;s &quot;replacement&quot; in the above project, but failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, private oil and gas corporations are not only at risk of receiving similar judgments from Shell, but also under increasing pressure from environmental activists and especially pressure from environmentalists. shareholders towards being responsible for the environment, cutting emissions. According to Business Insider, in US energy corporations, the percentage of shareholders in favor of cutting emissions now accounts for the majority, while this percentage is only about 6% in 2019. Currently, the Private oil and gas groups are aiming to cut output by 1-2% per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;state oil corporations&quot; (NOCs) of other countries are not under as much pressure as private energy corporations. Apparently, NOCs have almost no shareholders demanding emissions cuts. Not only that, there is also the fact that NOCs often do not provide enough information related to the environment as private companies in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding market demand, although the electric car industry is developing rapidly, the demand for petroleum and gas to operate production or means of transport such as trains, ships, airplanes... still needs gasoline. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, when Shell or Exxon Mobil, Chevron are looking to narrow their oil and gas operations, NOCs - which account for only about 50% of the total market output - are looking to expand. According to Bloomberg, it is likely that a NOC of&nbsp;China&nbsp;will take the place of Exxon Mobil in the joint venture of the oil and gas exploration project in Iraq mentioned above. NOCs such as Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia) or National Petroleum Corporation Abu Dhabi (UAE) ... are spending billions of dollars to increase production capacity. Similarly, Qatar Petroleum Corporation under the Qatar government is also investing an additional 30 billion USD to double export output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context that supply may be more limited, &nbsp;petroleum price&nbsp;&nbsp;is forecasted to increase in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crude oil prices skyrocketed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News reported yesterday that US crude oil prices rose to $71.5 per barrel, the highest since October 2018, while Brent crude prices rose to $73 per barrel. Crude oil prices have steadily increased since the beginning of this year, as businesses reopened and fuel demand for the transport sector picked up again. As of yesterday, the price of US crude oil was 23 USD/barrel more expensive than it was in January.</p>\r\n', 3, NULL, 50, '2021-11-12', 1, NULL);

In which, workers without contracts (freelance workers) and some other specific groups are supported at least 1.5 million VND/person or 50,000 VND/day. The report from the Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs before the National Assembly shows that this support package has been implemented quickly but has not been completed. Recently, Prime Minister &nbsp;Pham Minh Chinh&nbsp;&nbsp;also assigned ministries and sectors to study and propose an economic stimulus and support package estimated at VND 23,000 billion to support people through short-term jobs such as repairing roads; Planting trees, beautifying the public landscape and giving priority to poor households and unemployed people who are not entitled to unemployment benefits... In addition, the Ministry of Finance is studying and designing a new support package for treatment. cost about 24 trillion VND and proposed the Government to postpone the implementation of Circular 40 on taxes to support people and businesses...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to economic expert Vu Dinh Anh, the most necessary thing is to continue to accelerate the completion of the package of VND 26,000 billion. After that, we will continue to consider offering a new support package that is suitable and complements the shortcomings of the past policy, such as expanding the support object, extending the time and level of support. For example, the support package of VND 26,000 billion currently spends directly on self-employed workers of VND 1.5 million/person and gets a one-time payment without caring who still has to feed the whole family. Or there are students and other workers who are not supported under current regulations, but they also have no income and risk of going hungry when they have to stay at home. Meanwhile, the number of people severely affected by the Covid-19 epidemic that need support will increase as more and more provinces and cities have to implement distance according to Directive 16&nbsp;&nbsp;and the implementation time is also longer. .</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mở rộng l&ecirc;n 3 - 6 th&aacute;ng?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Ly Ngoc Diep, &quot;lecturer&quot; University of Auckland (New Zealand), economic team leader - Ho Chi Minh City project under the Association of Vietnamese Scientists and Experts Global (AVSE Global), analyzed that by the end of April 2021, Vietnam had spending 1.4% of GDP on direct support packages and public costs to fight the epidemic plus 0.5% on support loans, lower than the average of countries in the group of developing countries. What needs to be done now is to effectively disburse the support package of VND 26,000 billion. In addition to direct financial support, the Government should work with commercial banks to support debt repayment or debt restructuring for businesses and individuals financially affected by the epidemic. The government should also encourage and support those industries that are not essential and cannot work remotely, industries that may be hardest hit to actively seek new directions, new ways of doing things, and suitable new products/services. To be able to continue operating...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Pham The Anh, chief economist of the Institute for Economic and Policy Research, said that at this stage, the Government needs to increase the size of the direct support package even more for low-income people, especially when the number of The number of provinces and cities having to implement stronger and longer distances is increasing day by day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Huynh The Du, lecturer at the School of Public Policy and Fulbright Manager, commented: In the current context, the ability to apply Directive 16 or more is stronger for many provinces. The situation can last 6 months or more until herd immunity is achieved. In order for the enforcement of regulations to be strict and people to feel more secure at home, the state should immediately have a support package for the entire population equivalent to the 6 months&#39; food and electricity consumption needs of the low-income group. the shortest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Du calculated based on the average consumption of essential items in the survey of the General Statistics Office in 2020, the price announcement on July 5 of the Ca Mau Department of Finance... then the minimum monthly spending need for essential goods is 567,000 VND/person/month, equivalent to 3.4 million VND/person/6 months. Thus, the total support package for 6 months is 334 trillion VND, equivalent to 5% of the estimated GDP for 2021 of the whole country. However, in order to minimize the budget burden, according to Mr. Du, it is possible to choose the immediate option of supporting 3 months, which will be equivalent to 2.5% of GDP. If you want to reduce it further, you can reduce the amount of meat consumed by half (this part accounts for nearly 40% of total spending), so the support package is equivalent to 2% of the estimated GDP in 2021. With this support package, the the better off can be used for &nbsp;charity for the less fortunate. Then the mechanism of redistribution through the community will make everything more appropriate and fair. The government can first borrow money or the last way is to use the government&#39;s printed money (which is essentially a loan) to spend.</p>\r\n', 3, NULL, 55, '2021-11-12', 0, NULL);

This number is up 151% compared to September 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Over the past 18 months, we have seen significant growth in mining infrastructure in the US. We&#39;re also seeing a huge increase in the wave of looking to move mining to North America, mainly to the US,&quot; said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data set mentioned above does not include the number of miners who migrated en masse out of China, and experts told CNBC that the US share of the mining market is even bigger. According to Fred Thiel of Marathon Digital: &ldquo;500,000 formerly Chinese mining rigs are looking for new homes in the US. If implemented, that means North America will have almost 40% of the global hashrate by the end of 2022.&rdquo; Hashrate is a term that describes the overall computing power of the Bitcoin network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New mining mecca</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>America&#39;s growing dominance is a case in point when luck and preparedness meet. The US has been quietly building up its storage capacity for years. Before the real wave of Bitcoin miners started moving to the US, companies across the country took a gamble in the final belief that, if the infrastructure was in place, they would stand a chance. open a&nbsp;business&nbsp;in the US. That gamble now seems to have paid off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Bitcoin&#39;s value plummeted towards the end of 2017 and the broader crypto market entered a &quot;winter period,&quot; there was little demand for large Bitcoin mining camps. However, US miners saw a new door for them and quickly took the opportunity to mine cheap cryptocurrencies to build a mining ecosystem in the US. Major companies like cryptocurrency miner Core Scientific were constantly building up storage space during that lull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a &ldquo;cryptocurrency&rdquo; group created for professional miners, the maturing markets and &ldquo;financial&rdquo; instruments surrounding the mining industry also play a large role in the development. rapidity of cryptocurrency in the US. Brammer says many U.S. operators can begin to expand quickly, once they secure financing by leveraging a multi-year market track record of profitability and capital available to work. collateral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &nbsp;Covid-19&nbsp;&nbsp;epidemic is also a significant factor helping the US become the new Bitcoin mining center. While the pandemic has shut down a bunch of the global economy, the subsequent stimulus payments have proven beneficial for US miners. &ldquo;People look for places to deposit cash. The appetite for investment has never been greater. A large portion of this money has been poured into Bitcoin mining in markets outside of China,&rdquo; said Bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mining in America</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The seeds of the exodus to the US began to return in early 2020. It is a fact that before Beijing launched its sudden crackdown, China&#39;s Bitcoin mining dominance was already showing signs of slowing down. slope. The US becomes an attractive land because it seems to have everything a Bitcoin miner is always looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you are looking to move hundreds of millions of dollars mining companies out of China, you need to make sure you have geographic, political and jurisdictional stability. You also need to make sure you have private ownership safeguards in place for the property you&#39;re relocating,&rdquo; says Darin Feinstein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US is also home to some of the cheapest energy sources&nbsp;in the world, many of which tend to be renewable. Since miners at scale compete with each other in a low-margin industry, their only variable cost is often energy. They are encouraged to move to places with the cheapest electricity in the world. Fred Thiel expects most new miners moving to North America to be powered by renewable energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, according to Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, mining in the US is not entirely renewable. However, he concurs with the idea that cryptocurrency miners here will have more energy options than elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 3, NULL, 48, '2021-11-12', 1, NULL);

And the money saved from this was given to the newlyweds in the form of Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Shanky Singla, a 33-year-old businessman from Punjab, also returned to investing his savings in crypto this year after a long hiatus. Before coming to this decision, Singla carefully considered between gold and &nbsp;Bitcoin. &ldquo;The value of money decreases day by day, while Bitcoin&rsquo;s growth increases exponentially,&rdquo; Singla said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Reddy and Singla is part of a growing trend in India, where even members of the working class are now looking to invest assets in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. , especially in the context of economic instability due to the impact of the pandemic. According to Chainalysis, an American blockchain data analytics company, investment from India in &ldquo;cryptocurrency&rdquo; increased from $923 million in April 2020 to $6.6 billion in May 2021, a 615% jump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crypto craze is also driving young investors like Singla away from traditional investment categories like real estate or gold. In fact, the fact that jewelry stores have to be closed for a long time due to the Covid-19 epidemic is believed to be a factor that encourages people in a gold-loving country like India to turn to research alternatives. other way. Despite being the world&#39;s largest gold importer, India&#39;s gold imports last year fell to their lowest level in more than a decade. Gold demand also fell to a record in 2020 due to high prices, canceled festive shopping and postponed weddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tabassum M Adur, the 25-year-old founder of a PR firm in Karnataka, said she has more &ldquo;financial&rdquo; freedom and privacy when investing in cryptocurrencies. &ldquo;The whole process of investing and trading cryptocurrencies is seamless, much more fluid than with other available options,&rdquo; Adur said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Hitesh Malviya, blockchain and crypto investment expert, there are two groups behind the rise of cryptocurrencies: those who lost their jobs during the pandemic, looking for alternative sources of income, and those who lost their jobs during the pandemic. Experts have more time to research different investment options. &ldquo;The size of the first group is larger than the second, but the group of investors are the ones driving the big trading volume. They also have more information and a better understanding of the risks involved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on industry estimates, there may be more than 15 million crypto investors in India, but it is difficult to give exact figures. Kim Grauer, Research Director at Chainalysis, said that there was significant upward momentum in crypto purchases in February 2020, just before India fell into the second wave of Covid-19 infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Waiting for action from the government</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The growing interest in cryptocurrencies among the domestic population is prompting Indian officials to quickly consider how to regulate an industry that has long been plagued with hostility. According to the South China Morning Post, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a comprehensive ban on all forms of cryptocurrency trading in 2018. However, the Supreme Court of India changed that. this order last year. Currently, the RBI maintains an antagonistic stance towards cryptocurrencies, even while developing its own digital currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges and industry stakeholders have lobbied the Indian Ministry of Finance to come up with a roadmap to regulate trading of the currency. In March 2021, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would take a cautious approach to cryptocurrency trading and drop the ban altogether. &ldquo;We will not turn off all options,&rdquo; Ms. Sitharaman said, promising the government will soon come up with a plan on &nbsp;fintech&nbsp;and cryptocurrency trading. India&#39;s fintech (financial technology) is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, with six startups achieving unicorn status. valued at over $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to speculations from local media reports, the central government of India is likely to classify cryptocurrencies as an asset class. &ldquo;We believe the government will introduce more calibrated regulations for the crypto industry, including promoting crypto technology, supporting businesses, protecting investor funds, etc. ,&rdquo; said Avinash Shekhar, co-CEO of ZebPay, one of India&#39;s first crypto exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, however, the leading banks and payment gateways in the South Asian country are continuing to crack down on crypto trading at the behest of the RBI in 2018, despite the central bank&#39;s re-introduction. made it clear last month that the order is no longer in effect. This is seen as a big problem for exchanges and the cryptocurrency industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Hitesh Malviya, as long as the government can come up with clearer rules, the level of development of the crypto industry is likely to skyrocket. &ldquo;India has the potential to capture at least 20% of the global crypto trading and investment shares in the near future.
